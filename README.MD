## Structure

this project is structured in a way that you can duplicate the template folder and change the duplicate name to start on another sketch.

### Note

    * purely for creative and learning purposes right now
    * This git repo is going to hold the brancheas for my own learning of the p5 library.
    * I plan to turn this into a react app at some point
